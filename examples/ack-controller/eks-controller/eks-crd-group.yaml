                    An access entry allows an IAM principal (user or role) to access your cluster.
                    Access entries can replace the need to maintain the aws-auth ConfigMap for
                    authentication. For more information about access entries, see Access entries

                        a Kubernetes RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding object. Amazon EKS doesn't
                        confirm that the value for name exists in any bindings on your cluster. You
                        can specify one or more names.

                        Kubernetes authorizes the principalArn of the access entry to access any
                        cluster objects that you've specified in a Kubernetes Role or ClusterRole
                        object that is also specified in a binding's roleRef. For more information

                        objects, see Using RBAC Authorization in the Kubernetes documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

                        If you want Amazon EKS to authorize the principalArn (instead of, or in addition
                        to Kubernetes authorizing the principalArn), you can associate one or more
                        access policies to the access entry using AssociateAccessPolicy. If you associate
                        any access policies, the principalARN has all permissions assigned in the
                        associated access policies and all permissions in any Kubernetes Role or
                        ClusterRole objects that the group names are bound to.

                        The ARN of the IAM principal for the AccessEntry. You can specify one ARN
                        for each access entry. You can't specify the same ARN in more than one access
                        entry. This value can't be changed after access entry creation.

                        The valid principals differ depending on the type of the access entry in
                        the type field. The only valid ARN is IAM roles for the types of access entries
                        for nodes: . You can use every IAM principal type for STANDARD access entries.
                        You can't use the STS session principal type with access entries because
                        this is a temporary principal for each session and not a permanent identity
                        that can be assigned permissions.

                        IAM best practices (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-users-federation-idp)
                        recommend using IAM roles with temporary credentials, rather than IAM users
                        with long-term credentials.

                        EC2_LINUX, and EC2_WINDOWS.

                        If the principalArn is for an IAM role that's used for self-managed Amazon
                        EC2 nodes, specify EC2_LINUX or EC2_WINDOWS. Amazon EKS grants the necessary
                        permissions to the node for you. If the principalArn is for any other purpose,
                        specify STANDARD. If you don't specify a value, Amazon EKS sets the value
                        to STANDARD. It's unnecessary to create access entries for IAM roles used
                        with Fargate profiles or managed Amazon EC2 nodes, because Amazon EKS creates
                        entries in the aws-auth ConfigMap for the roles. You can't change this value
                        once you've created the access entry.

                        If you set the value to EC2_LINUX or EC2_WINDOWS, you can't specify values
                        for kubernetesGroups, or associate an AccessPolicy to the access entry.

                        How to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on. Conflicts
                        are handled based on the value you choose:

                          * None – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your
                          cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of the add-on might
                          fail.

                          * Overwrite – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed
                          on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is different than the
                          existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to the Amazon EKS default
                          value.

                          * Preserve – This is similar to the NONE option. If the self-managed
                          version of the add-on is installed on your cluster Amazon EKS doesn't
                          change the add-on resource properties. Creation of the add-on might fail
                          if conflicts are detected. This option works differently during the update
                          operation. For more information, see UpdateAddon (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAddon.html).

                        If you don't currently have the self-managed version of the add-on installed
                        on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed. Amazon EKS sets all
                        values to default values, regardless of the option that you specify.

                        the add-on. If you don't specify an existing IAM role, then the add-on uses
                        the permissions assigned to the node IAM role. For more information, see

                        To specify an existing IAM role, you must have an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC)
                        provider created for your cluster. For more information, see Enabling IAM

                        of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't propagate to
                        any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.

                        The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                          * Maximum number of tags per resource – 50

                          * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
                          have only one value.

                          * Maximum key length – 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                          * Maximum value length – 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                          * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
                          remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
                          Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable
                          in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                          * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                          * Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such
                          as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web
                          Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                          Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
