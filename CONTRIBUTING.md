# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

Before filing an issue, please check to see if there's an existing or recently closed issue. If a similar issue already exists, please consider adding an upvote and your own details.

Please try to include detailed descriptions in issues. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of actions you took to discover the issue;
* The version being used, or commit if a local build;
* Any modifications you've made that may be relevant to the issue;
* Any details about your environment or deployment that may be interesting

Note to keep things tidy and moving along, the maintainers may close issues that appear to be duplicates, are incomplete, or have no discussion for a period of time.

If an issue is closed, and you feel like it needs to be open, we are always open to discussion.


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please:

1. Check existing open or recently merged pull requests to ensure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
2. Allow for time to discuss any significant work. Conversation can be driven on issues, or Work-in-progress (WIP) PRs can work as well (use "WIP" in your PR title). This is an active project with specific goals, it's best to discuss major changes.
3. Work against the latest source on the *main* branch.

Unless the work is very obvious (e.g. a few lines to fix a bug), please make sure your PR has a related Issue. If there are no existing issues, please create one to describe the need.

To send create a Pull Request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make commits in your fork.
   * Please focus on the specific change you are contributing.
   * If your work must include changes in various functional areas, consider using multiple commits so they can be reviewed and managed atomically.
   * If your change includes large scale reformats, please separate these changes into their own commits. It is difficult to review reformats and implementation changes together.
3. Please ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Create a PR from your fork, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Monitor for automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation (followups, rebases, etc are all part of the process).

GitHub provides nice documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

As with issues above, to keep things tidy and moving along, the maintainers may close PRs that appear to be duplicates, are incomplete and have no discussion for a period of time, or that don't follow the process in spirit.

If a PR is closed, and you feel like it needs to be open, we are always open to discussion.


## Development setup

Setup the [local environment](docs/developer-getting-started.md) to build and test the code locally.

## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to work on. As the project uses the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.


## Code of Conduct
