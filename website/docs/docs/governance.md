# Governance

**kro** is not a CNCF project, but follows the CNCF governance model,
which is designed to ensure that the project is run in a transparent
and inclusive manner. kro is currently governed by a small group of
maintainers - from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft - who are responsible
for the overall direction and management of the project, as well as
for the technical decisions that affect the project.
